# Tibial PCL Avulsion Fractures Dataset

## Overview

This dataset contains numerical curve data and 3D models related to tibial posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) avulsion fractures. The dataset was curated from 58 patients treated at Emdadi Hospital, Mashhad, Iran, between 2018 and 2021. It serves as a valuable resource for biomechanical analysis and fracture modeling.

### Dataset Highlights
- **Total cases**: 58 patients (53 men, 5 women).
- **Fracture fragment statistics**:
  - **Male patients**:
    - 72.4% (n=42): Single fragment.
    - 17.2% (n=10): Two fragments.
    - 6.9% (n=4): Three fragments.
    - 1.7% (n=1): Four fragments.
    - 1.7% (n=1): Seven fragments.
  - **Female patients**:
    - 100% (n=5): Single fragment.

### Description of Files
- **Curves**:  
  Text files containing numerical representations of fracture curves. Each file corresponds to one patient case.
  
- **STL**:  
  3D surface models of the fractures in STL format, representing the geometry of each fracture.

- **Sample**:  
  A subset of the STL files for demonstration purposes.

## Usage

This dataset is ideal for:
- **Fracture analysis**: Statistical studies of fracture patterns.
- **3D modeling**: Biomechanical simulations and visualizations.
- **Algorithm development**: Training and testing algorithms for fracture detection and classification.

### Recommended Tools
- **3D Model Visualization**: MeshLab, ParaView, or Blender.
- **Numerical Data Processing**: Python (NumPy, Pandas) or MATLAB.

## Dataset Statistics

The dataset includes detailed information on fracture fragments:
- **Single fragment**: 81% of cases (47 patients).
- **Multiple fragments**: 19% of cases (11 patients), with variations up to seven fragments in rare instances.
